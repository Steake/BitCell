> _"We don't mine blocks. We cultivate them in a Conway garden where only the fittest gliders survive."_

## What Even Is This?

BitCell is a blockchain where consensus is decided by **Conway's Game of Life tournaments**. Yes, really. No SHA-256 lottery. No boring PoS validators clicking buttons. Just pure, deterministic, beautiful cellular automaton combat.

**Now in Release Candidate 1** with production-ready VRF, persistent state, hardware wallet support, light client implementation, and a complete ZKVM execution framework.

## 🎉 RC1 Highlights (v0.1.0-rc1)

BitCell RC1 represents the first complete implementation of the core protocol:

- **Production ECVRF**: Real cryptographic VRF using Ristretto255 for fair proposer selection
- **RocksDB Persistence**: Full state management with pruning and block archival
- **Light Client**: Header-only sync with Merkle proofs (<100MB memory)
- **Hardware Wallets**: Complete support for Ledger/Trezor via abstraction layer
- **Smart Contracts**: BCL compiler + ZKVM with 22 opcodes and gas metering
- **Admin Console**: Production-ready dashboard with HSM integration and testnet faucet
- **Security Hardening**: DoS protection, gas limits, input validation, VRF race condition fixes
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 200+ tests passing across all crates

See [RC1 Release Notes](docs/RC-1-Release_Notes.md) for complete details.

### Core Vibes

- 🎮 **Tournament Consensus**: Miners battle with gliders in a 1024×1024 CA arena
- 🎭 **Ring Signature Anonymity**: Your glider, your battle, not your identity  
- 🧠 **Protocol-Local EBSL**: Reputation that actually means something
- 🔐 **ZK-Everything**: Private smart contracts via Groth16 circuits with Merkle gadgets
- ⚡ **Deterministic Work**: No lottery, no variance, just skill and creativity
- 🌐 **Anti-Cartel by Design**: Random pairings + ring sigs = coordination nightmare
- 🔗 **Production VRF**: ECVRF (Ristretto255) for fair block proposer selection
- 💾 **Persistent State**: RocksDB backend with state snapshots and pruning
- 🏦 **Hardware Wallet Ready**: Full support for Ledger, Trezor, and HSM integration

## Why Though?

Because proof-of-work shouldn't be about who has the most GPUs. It should be about **emergent complexity**, **creative strategy**, and **provable computation**. BitCell replaces hash grinding with something actually interesting: designing glider patterns that survive CA evolution better than your opponents.

Plus, we needed a blockchain where "gas wars" could literally mean glider battles. 🚀

## Quick Start (For The Impatient)

```bash
# Clone the vibes
git clone https://github.com/Steake/BitCell
cd BitCell

# Build the future
cargo build --release

# Run tests (watch CA battles in real-time)
cargo test --all -- --nocapture

# Individual crate tests
cargo test -p bitcell-crypto  # Cryptographic primitives
cargo test -p bitcell-ca      # Cellular automaton engine
cargo test -p bitcell-ebsl    # Trust & reputation system
```

## The Tournament Protocol (The Good Stuff)

Each block height runs a bracket-style tournament:

1. **Eligibility Check**: Protocol computes `M_h` (miners with `bond ≥ B_MIN` and `trust ≥ T_MIN`)
2. **Commit Phase**: Miners submit `H(glider_pattern || nonce)` with ring signatures
3. **VRF Seed**: Combine last `k` blocks' VRF outputs → `seed_h`
4. **Pairing**: Deterministic shuffle using `seed_h` → bracket structure
5. **Reveal Phase**: Miners reveal patterns; non-revealers forfeit
6. **Battle Simulation**: Each pair battles for 1000 CA steps
7. **ZK Proof**: Winner proves battle validity via Groth16 circuit
8. **Block Proposal**: Tournament winner executes contracts, generates proofs, proposes block
9. **Full Verification**: All validators check all proofs (no sampling in consensus)

### Example Battle

```
Miner A: Heavyweight Spaceship (160 energy)
Miner B: Standard Glider (100 energy)

Grid: 1024×1024 toroidal
Steps: 1000
Spawn: A at (256, 512), B at (768, 512)

After 1000 steps:
  Region A energy: 5,847
  Region B energy: 3,291

Winner: Miner A 🎉
```

## Protocol-Local EBSL (Trust Without Oracles)

Every miner has evidence counters:

- **r_m**: Positive (good blocks, honest participation)
- **s_m**: Negative (invalid blocks, missed reveals, equivocation)

Trust score computed as:

```
R = r_m + s_m
T_m = r_m/(R+K) + α·K/(R+K)
```

With `K=2`, `α=0.4`:

- **New miners**: Start at `T = 0.4` (below eligibility `T_MIN = 0.75`)
- **Good behavior**: Builds `r_m`, increases trust
- **Bad behavior**: Builds `s_m` faster, tanks trust quickly
- **Equivocation**: Instant `T → 0`, full slash, permanent ban

Decay per epoch:
- `r_m *= 0.99` (positive decays faster)
- `s_m *= 0.999` (negative decays slower - long memory)

## ZK-SNARK Circuits (Modular by Design)

Four circuit structures defined in RC1:

### 1. Battle Circuit `C_battle`
**Public**: commitments, winner, seed, positions  
**Private**: initial grid, patterns, nonce  
**Verifies**: CA evolution + commitment consistency + outcome  
**Status**: Structure complete, full constraints in RC2

### 2. Execution Circuit `C_exec`
**Public**: old state root, new state root, gas used  
**Private**: plaintext state, contract code, witness  
**Verifies**: ZKVM execution correctness  
**Status**: Structure complete, full constraints in RC2

### 3. State Transition Circuit `C_state`
**Public**: old root, new root, nullifiers  
**Private**: Merkle paths, cleartext values  
**Verifies**: State commitment updates  
**Status**: ✅ Complete with non-equality constraints

### 4. Merkle Path Circuit `C_merkle`
**Public**: root, leaf, index  
**Private**: path siblings  
**Verifies**: Merkle inclusion proofs in R1CS  
**Status**: ✅ Complete with Poseidon hash gadget

**Each block** carries `N_h - 1` battle proofs + execution proofs + state proofs.

**RC1**: Circuit structures and mock proofs  
**RC2**: Full R1CS constraints and real Groth16 proofs  
**RC3**: Recursive aggregation via Plonk/STARK

## Economics (Bitcoin-Style Halving)

```
Initial block reward: 50 CELL
Halving interval: 210,000 blocks (~4 years)
Maximum halvings: 64 (subsidy reaches 0)
Total supply: ~21 million CELL

block_reward = base_subsidy(h) + tx_fees + contract_fees

Distribution:
  60% → Tournament winner (proposer)
  30% → All participants (weighted by round reached)
  10% → Treasury / dev fund
```

The payout is **deterministically computed** from the tournament bracket. Proposer can't cheat it or the block is invalid.

## Smart Contracts (Privacy Native)

```rust
// On-chain: Only commitments and proofs
let new_commitment = commit(new_state, random_nonce);
let exec_proof = prove_execution(old_state, new_state, function);
let state_proof = prove_state_transition(old_root, new_root);

// Off-chain: Prover decrypts and executes privately
let old_state = decrypt_with_user_key(old_commitment, secret);
let new_state = run_function(function, args, old_state);

// Validators: Never see plaintext, only verify proofs
verify_proof(exec_proof, public_inputs);
verify_proof(state_proof, public_inputs);
```

## FAQ

**Q: Is this a joke?**  
A: No. We're dead serious about CA tournaments. RC1 is deployed and working.

**Q: Can I win by just using the biggest glider?**  
A: Maybe initially, but strategy matters. Lightweight gliders can outmaneuver heavier ones.

**Q: What's the TPS?**  
A: RC1 achieves approximately 50 TPS in local testing (tested with 3-node configuration, transaction batches of 100). Target is 100+ TPS in RC2 with optimizations. We're not trying to be Solana—we're optimizing for security and interesting consensus.

**Q: Why not just use PoS?**  
A: Because clicking "stake" buttons is boring. Designing glider strategies is art.

**Q: Is it quantum-resistant?**  
A: CA evolution is fundamentally quantum-resistant. We use classical crypto for signatures (ECDSA, ECVRF), which is upgradable to post-quantum algorithms.

**Q: Can I run this on a Raspberry Pi?**  
A: Validator: probably not (ZK proving is heavy, requires 8GB+ RAM). Light client: yes (implemented in RC1).

**Q: What's the energy consumption?**  
A: Way less than Bitcoin. CA simulation is deterministic and parallelizable, not hash grinding.

**Q: When mainnet?**  
A: After completing RC2, RC3, and comprehensive security audits. Timeline depends on audit findings and meeting all production readiness criteria. Estimated 2026, subject to change.
