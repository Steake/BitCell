# BitCell Testnet Faucet Configuration Example
#
# This file shows how to configure the testnet faucet service.
# Copy this to your deployment and adjust values as needed.

# Amount to distribute per request (in smallest units)
# 1 CELL = 1_000_000_000 smallest units
# Default: 1_000_000_000 (1 CELL)
FAUCET_AMOUNT=1000000000

# Minimum time between requests from the same address (in seconds)
# Default: 3600 (1 hour)
FAUCET_RATE_LIMIT=3600

# Maximum number of requests per address per day
# Default: 5
FAUCET_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DAY=5

# Faucet wallet private key (hex format, with or without 0x prefix)
# ⚠️  SECURITY: Never commit this to version control!
# ⚠️  Use environment variables or secrets management in production
# Generate a new wallet for testnet use only
FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY=

# BitCell node RPC endpoint
FAUCET_NODE_RPC_HOST=127.0.0.1
FAUCET_NODE_RPC_PORT=8545

# Enable CAPTCHA verification (true/false)
# ⚠️  WARNING: CAPTCHA validation is NOT implemented
# ⚠️  If enabled, the faucet will reject all requests
# ⚠️  Keep this disabled until proper CAPTCHA verification is added
# Recommended: false
# Default: false
FAUCET_REQUIRE_CAPTCHA=false

# Maximum balance an address can have to receive funds (optional)
# Prevents addresses from accumulating too many testnet tokens
# Set to 0 or omit to disable this check
# Default: 10_000_000_000 (10 CELL)
FAUCET_MAX_RECIPIENT_BALANCE=10000000000

# Admin console bind address
ADMIN_CONSOLE_HOST=127.0.0.1
ADMIN_CONSOLE_PORT=8080

# Logging level (trace, debug, info, warn, error)

# Example deployment configurations:

# --- Development (generous limits for testing) ---
# FAUCET_AMOUNT=5000000000
# FAUCET_RATE_LIMIT=300
# FAUCET_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DAY=20
# FAUCET_REQUIRE_CAPTCHA=false

# --- Public Testnet (conservative limits) ---
# FAUCET_AMOUNT=1000000000
# FAUCET_RATE_LIMIT=3600
# FAUCET_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DAY=5
# FAUCET_REQUIRE_CAPTCHA=false  # Keep disabled until CAPTCHA is implemented

# --- Stress Testing (higher throughput) ---
# FAUCET_AMOUNT=10000000000
# FAUCET_RATE_LIMIT=60
# FAUCET_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DAY=100
# FAUCET_REQUIRE_CAPTCHA=false
